# TODO List

- [x] Add a helper class that will take care of the subject and modelPath, and has functions for relationship types
- [x] Write unit tests for it
- [x] Update documentation for it
- [ ] See if you can detect the modelPath by default?
- [ ] Replace tsdx with TypeScript and Mocha
- [ ] Automate publishing NPM packages
